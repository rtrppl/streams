#+title: streams.el

*streams* is a small package that allows to collect and start online media streams. Added streams can be organized into groups or searched from a general list. [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]] is used to play the streams and therefore a requirement.

** Change log

*0.1* 
- initial release

** Installation

As mentioned above, you need to install [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]].

*** Option a)

Then clone the repository:

=git clone https://github.com/rtrppl/streams=

To run *streams*, you need to load the package by adding it to your .emacs or init.el:

#+begin_src elisp
(load "/path/to/streams/streams.el") 
#+end_src

You should set a binding to either =streams= or =streams-select-stream-from-group=. All my *streams* bindings start with "C-c v", hence my choice below.

#+begin_src elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d S") 'streams)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d s") 'streams-select-stream-from-group)
#+end_src

*** Option b)

If you use straight, you could just add this:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package streams
  :straight (:host github :repo "rtrppl/streams")
  :bind
  (:map global-map)
  ("C-c v S" . streams)
  ("C-c v s" . streams-select-stream-from-group))
#+end_src

** Usage

There are only five user-facing functions in *streams*:

- *streams-add-webstream* adds a webstream

- *streams-remove-webstream* removes a webstream

- *streams-modify-group* creates groups and adds or removes a webstream to a specific group

- *streams* starts a webstream

- *streams-select-stream-from-group* start a webstream from a group

** Finding streams

There are several collections with online stream on GitHub, see for example [[https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/tree/master/streams][iptv/streams at master Â· iptv-org/iptv]], [[https://github.com/Free-TV/IPTV/tree/master][Free-TV/IPTV: M3U Playlist for free TV channels]] or [[https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams][mikepierce/internet-radio-streams: Curated List of Internet Radio Streams]].

If you have [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]] installed, adding Youtube channels may also be possible.
